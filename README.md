##Image Recognition App

This app uses the Clarifai API to take an image url and using Image Recognition look for objects and information in the image. It then sends back tags that apply to what is seen in the image and the probability that the tag is correct.
(ie: man 98.233%, outdoors 92.754%)

This is my first use of AI through and API to detect things in an image.
